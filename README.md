# Java Game Engine.

A basic 2D Java game engine.

## Features

### 1. Fully responsive and customizable graphics.
  
Every component on screen is fully customisable including:  
  
    • taskbar  
    • frame  
    • exit button  
    • minimize button  
    • close button  
    • taskbar icon  

The game screen centers when the frame resizes.  
  
### 2. Efficient asset loading.  

  The engine automatically searches for every asset you can load.  
  No need to explicitly mention every asset loaded through code.
